# Building Individually Targeted Improvement Plan for Hitters
Group players according to their swing mechanism using Blast data from practice. Then build individually targeted improvement plans for all groups of hitters by looking at their Trackman data from games. I also built models to come up with my own xwOBA to further evaluate their performance.
